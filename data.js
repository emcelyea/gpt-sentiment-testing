He was only wearing boxers and sweaty as hell and so he got covered in orange dust. I think he genuinely believed he was in a toilet.  He spent most of the night covered in orange dorito dust, barely saying a word, grunting and gnawing on a wooden broom handle.  He was like a spectuclar cheesy gurning ape-man.  It was amazing"},
    // {"sentiment": 6, "message":"Brit here. It would honestly shock our ranch-loving American friends just how unavailable ranch is over here. You'd be extremely lucky to find any bottles of ranch dressing tucked away in any supermarket.\n\nHell, we have ranch Doritos, but we don't even call it ranch. We call it \"Cool Original\". Any time anyone stumbles into ranch flavoured anything here, they just say \"hey, this tastes a bit like blue Doritos\"."},

The mini shredded chicken quesadillas from Taco Bell‚Ä¶. Honestly, my list goes on and on. We have a running joke in my family that if I love it- it will inevitably either be discontinued, cancelled, or closed down."},

I only drank sodas, juices, and beers, but never water.  In one sitting I could put back a whole El Paso 10pc Doritos locos taco kit in one night and still feel hungry. Not to mention the amount of cheese I put on the tacos itself üòÆ‚Äçüí®. My fat boy era was sum serious."},

Couple of bags of Doritos (or better: Mexicano less breakage and you have plenty of flavor it's a bean delivery method not the main event)"},
    // {"sentiment": 8, "message":"A cat attacked and chased one of our hens. She was gone, leaving a bunch of feathers all over the yard and in a trail down the alley. I was sure she wasn't alive, but she was my man's favorite hen. She spent the night on the car roof fighting off a cat trying to attack her. Then she ran into their bushes and hid.\n\n She was scared and didn't want to come out of the bushes, but my man finally lured her with her favorite treat, Cool ranch Doritos crumbs. He'd hold up the bag and shake it. She'd cluck back. Shake, cluck, shake, cluck. Finally she came out and let him pick her up."},

    {"sentiment": 6, "message":"Doritos are primarily corn, which many folks won‚Äôt consume during Pesach, as corn is classified as kitniyot. They are also fried in kitniyot-derived oils (corn, sunflower, soybean) and contain maltodextrin (can be derived from corn or wheat), partially hydrogenated oils (including soybean oil), and corn flour.\n\nBeer can be made with barley, wheat, corn, rice, and/or oats, depending on the producer."},

I highly doubt he has an airborne allergy to it, and if he did, he'd be way dead by now. I mean it's in basically all processed food. If he had an airborne allergy someone opening a bag of Doritos on the train would be life threatening. \n\nThe original terms were pretty reasonable, I wouldn't bend on this OP\n\nNTA"},
